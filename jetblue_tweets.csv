I’ve had some bad #CustomerExperience’s, but this is the worst!  Callous, inconsiderate, placating.  Would you treat customers like that @SouthwestAir? @JetBlue? @united?"

2025-04-23 00:41:56+00:00,@JetBlue Really disappointing to be in Row 12 on a late flight with mandatory bag checks? This is a big plane and not necessary. I haven’t checked a bag in 10 years of flying every week. Perhaps that comes with collapsing multiple sold out flights?

It’s worked wonderfully if you consider how poorly B6 is doing financially.  Sure, they fly to Heathrow now, but their balance sheet is a disaster, while Alaska continues to make money 🤷‍♂️"
2025-04-23 01:40:49+00:00,"@JetBlue are you just broke? 

Like why has terminal 5 at jfk become shithole that feels dirty and old?

Aside from the terrible attitude of airport employees the place is a dump. 

Mismanaged? Whatever it’s, it’s like being in foreign land"
2025-04-23 03:00:19+00:00,"@JetBlue, I’m in disbelief. I just purchased a ticket, only to discover  that I don’t have a seat assigned! I’m being told I must pay extra for a  seat, and the cost is far more than the ticket itself. This situation  is beyond frustrating. How can this be happening?"
